#comments (octothorpe)

# A comment, this is so you can read your program later
# Anything after the # is ignored by python

print("I could have code like this") # and this is ignored

#print ("This won't run")

print ("This will run.")


# print ("Hi # There") will still work because the # is in a STRING
# hence they are considered as just characters
